### Really Easily Build an Android APK on an Android Device (Smartphone and Tablet).

You can try building hundreds of exciting, amazing and beautiful APKs by running [shell scripts](https://www.google.com/search?q=shell+scripts) from this directory.  It is simple!  The minimal install size to start building your first app is about 3.8MB!  Have fun and enjoy compiling, hacking, modifying and running these select APKs!

Prefix these bash scripts by typing dot slash `./` on your Android smartphone or tablet in Termux, i.e. type `./b` at the prompt ($), press TAB TAB (x2).  The prompt should magically add `uild`; Then add a capitol `A`, then a small `l`.  Press TAB TAB (x2) again.  This should build the following command on the command line `./buildAll.sh` for you.  Press enter (return) in `~/buildAPKs/sources/`.  Additional CLI information at [The Linux Documentation Project.](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=command+line+beginner+site%3Atldp.org)

The [`buildAll.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/master/scripts/build/buildAll.sh) command shall build hundreds of APKs on your device.  Maximum space allotment for complete build of everything available is about 420MB for buildAPKs and all the submodules, plus about 65MB for the finished products deposited into /sdcard/Download/builtAPKs; 590 Android applications are made from source code on device. 

These built APKs will be deposited into /sdcard/Download/builtAPKs for installing on smartphone and tablet through the file manager.  The minimal install size to start building your first app is about 3.8MB!  Have fun and enjoy compiling, hacking, modifying and running these select APKs!
